Hello Queer Coders!

Queer Code London now has over 480 members – welcome to everyone! The last month has been full of events. Thanks to everyone who attended our last few, including the September Bites & Bytes, the CaBiRet social, two co-working events, the super successful Rainbows & Lightning evening of talks, our latest breakfast event, and a boardgames social.

### News!

#### Queer Code Yorkshire

There's a new chapter of Queer Code starting up – in Yorkshire! Our very own founders Daniel and Franzi will be going up to give talks at [their first ever event](https://qcyorks-nov17.eventbrite.com) on Thursday, 2nd November in Leeds. Franzi’s talk will be ‘Refactoring Mount Doom – Tackling Legacy Code’ and Daniel’s talk will be ‘Discipline in Code’. This is also going to be an opportunity to meet Queer Coders and discuss what Queer Code Yorkshire should look like.

Please help get the word out and let any Queer Coders you might know in Yorkshire or the general area know about it!

#### Organisation Survey

We’ve put together [an organisation survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7gfVCpq817YOLYkVvUL7vaXOFw5kZnIa_NPOlUVqgxsslqg/viewform) to try to better understand what could help more people get involved with organising Queer Code London. If you haven’t taken the survey already we’d still love to hear from you. The survey will be live until the end of the month.

The survey is completely anonymous and we really want to get opinions from organisers and non-organisers on what would help you get more involved with organising, what stops you getting involved, or just to know that you don't want to be involved with organising. If you don’t feel that you can answer the questions in the survey as they are, you’re also more than welcome to just write anything you’re thinking in the ‘anything else’ box at the end.

### Upcoming events

Our next event is this Saturday, 21st October: [Lunch & Code With Jo Franchetti](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/241463339/). This is our regular Lunch & Code at uSwitch. We'll have a talk from Jo Franchetti, a frontend developer, coach, and organiser. The talk will be ‘CSS in JS demystified’, covering a brief history of CSS in JS and how styled components can help us with namespacing in our CSS.

After Saturday, the next event is our now regular [Breakfast & Catch-up](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/244179707/) on Wednesday, 1st November at Pivotal from 8am. We’ll chat and socialise with a general theme of what interesting things we’ve been working on recently.

We are also pleased to announce our [Global day of Coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org/) event taking place on Saturday, 18th November. This event is in collaboration with [Ladies of Code](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/). Throughout the day we’ll be coding Conway’s Game of Life, working with different partners to try to solve the problem. As we go we add different restrictions to force ourselves to consider different approaches. Then we throw away the code we’ve written and try a new restriction!

### Welfare

Please get in touch with Sam (@onlyskin on Slack) if you have any issues / concerns / anxiety about anything to do with Queer Code London that you’d like to raise safely and/or privately with the group or organisers.

### Buddy scheme

We run a buddy scheme. This is available to anyone who wants to come to an event and would feel more comfortable meeting someone friendly before the event. If you would like to use the buddy scheme, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md) and submit an email with the specified information. We will do our best to arrange someone to meet with you before the event.

### Organiser buddy scheme

Given the success of the regular buddy scheme, Queer Code London is trialing a new type of Buddy Scheme – the Organiser Buddy Scheme! If you'd like to help out by organising an event but
would feel more comfortable doing it with someone else who has previously organised events, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/organiser_buddy.md)
and submit an email with your information; one of the organisers will get in touch to help you figure out which event you could help organise.

### Photo policy

We want to get more queer coders excited about us! What better way to show them than by having some photos up so they can see what it’s like at our meetups. We will dedicate one person for the next few meetups to take some photos.

We have a special marker for nametags if you are okay with being in photos (this is an opt-in system).

If you are in one of our published photos and you are not happy, please feel free to tell the organisers and we will stop using it. This is our first photo policy and we are open to feedback on how to improve it!

### Thanks to our sponsors

We want to say thank you to Pivotal Labs, uSwitch, Makers Academy, and 8th Light for hosting us, and providing the space and food/drinks for our meetups.
Thanks also to JetBrains for providing us with IDE licenses to raffle at our events.
