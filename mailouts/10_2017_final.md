Hello Queer Coders!

Queer Code London now has over 480 members – welcome to everyone! The last month has been full of events. Thanks to everyone who attended our last few, including the September Bites & Bytes, the CaBiRet social, two co-working events, the super successful Rainbows & Lightning evening of talks, our latest breakfast event, and a boardgames social.

### News!

#### Organisation Survey

We’ve put together [an organisation survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7gfVCpq817YOLYkVvUL7vaXOFw5kZnIa_NPOlUVqgxsslqg/viewform) to try to better understand what could help more people get involved with organising Queer Code London. If you haven’t taken the survey already we’d still love to hear from you. The survey will be live until the end of the month.

The survey is completely anonymous and we really want to get opinions from organisers and non-organisers on what would help you get more involved with organising, what stops you getting involved, or just to know that you don't want to be involved with organising. If you don’t feel that you can answer the questions in the survey as they are, you’re also more than welcome to just write anything you’re thinking in the ‘anything else’ box at the end.

#### Franzi is leaving
Sadly, Franzi will be leaving us in a few weeks for a new job in Zurich. We'll miss you Franzi!

This means the co-working event needs a new organiser. If you think you’d be able to try your hand at running one or more of these events, let us know. You’ll be able to tap in and out at any time. Here’s what it entails:
- contact one of our three existing venues to confirm a date (Franzi will help remotely)
- set up a meetup.com event (can copy from the existing ones, Franzi will help remotely)
- send information about participants and dietary requirements to the venue (Franzi will help remotely)
- be there a few minutes early to check in with the security guard and put out some signs and nametags
- be present during the whole event: greet everyone, deal with concerns of participants, and make sure the place is left in a good state
- send a thank you to the venue

#### Queer Code Yorkshire

There's a new chapter of Queer Code starting up – in Yorkshire! Our very own founders Daniel and Franzi will be going up to give talks at [their first ever event](https://qcyorks-nov17.eventbrite.com) on Thursday, 2nd November in Leeds. Franzi’s talk will be ‘Refactoring Mount Doom – Tackling Legacy Code’ and Daniel’s talk will be ‘Discipline in Code’. This is also going to be an opportunity to meet Queer Coders and discuss what Queer Code Yorkshire should look like.

Please help get the word out and let any Queer Coders you might know in Yorkshire or the general area know about it.

### Organiser buddy scheme

Given the success of the regular buddy scheme, Queer Code London is trialing a new type of Buddy Scheme – the Organiser Buddy Scheme! If you'd like to help out by organising an event but
would feel more comfortable doing it with someone else who has previously organised events, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/organiser_buddy.md)
and submit an email with your information; one of the organisers will get in touch to help you figure out which event you could help organise.

We're particularly looking for someone who could help organise one of our upcoming Bites & Bytes evening events, so if you think that might be you don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

### Upcoming events

Our next event is this Saturday, 21st October: [Lunch & Code With Jo Franchetti](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/241463339/). This is our regular Lunch & Code at uSwitch. We'll have a talk from Jo Franchetti, a frontend developer, coach, and organiser. The talk will be ‘CSS in JS demystified’, covering a brief history of CSS in JS and how styled components can help us with namespacing in our CSS.

After Saturday, the next event is our now regular [Breakfast & Catch-up](https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/events/244179707/) on Wednesday, 1st November at Pivotal from 8am. We’ll chat and socialise with a general theme of what interesting things we’ve been working on recently.

We also have our [Global day of Coderetreat](http://queer-code.org/london/coderetreat2017/) taking place on Saturday, 18th November. This event is in collaboration with [Ladies of Code](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/). We have room for a lot more people than usual and we're really excited for this to be our biggest event yet!

What is Coderetreat?

Coderetreat is a really fun day with the goal of improving our coding skills and learning from each other. There will be groups from all over the world participating.

It follows a particular structure:
- start with a simple programming problem: Conway’s Game of Life
- work with different partners to discuss and solve the problem
- add restrictions to force you to consider different approaches
- after each round, throw out your code, discuss your experience and repeat!

### Queer Code on all channels

### Welfare

Please get in touch with Sam (@onlyskin on Slack) if you have any issues / concerns / anxiety about anything to do with Queer Code London that you’d like to raise safely and/or privately with the group or organisers.

### Buddy scheme

We run a buddy scheme. This is available to anyone who wants to come to an event and would feel more comfortable meeting someone friendly before the event. If you would like to use the buddy scheme, please visit our [application page](https://github.com/qcldn/docs/blob/master/buddy.md) and submit an email with the specified information. We will do our best to arrange someone to meet with you before the event.

### Photo policy

We want to get more queer coders excited about us! What better way to show them than by having some photos up so they can see what it’s like at our meetups. We will dedicate one person for the next few meetups to take some photos.

We have a special marker for nametags if you are okay with being in photos (this is an opt-in system).

If you are in one of our published photos and you are not happy, please feel free to tell the organisers and we will stop using it. This is our first photo policy and we are open to feedback on how to improve it!

### Thanks to our sponsors

We want to say thank you to FutureLearn, Makers Academy, Moo, Pivotal Labs, uSwitch, and 8th Light for hosting us this month, and providing the space and food/drinks for our meetups.
